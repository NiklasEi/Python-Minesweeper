# Python-Minesweeper
For learning purposes I recreated minesweeper using python


Start a game with
```
python minesweeper.py
```

The standard game has a 20x20 grid and 40 mines to find. The number of set flags and the number of mines in the whole game are displayed as "flags/mines" in the title.

To change the standard you can start the game with your preferred grid size and number of mines as arguments like so:

```
python minesweeper.py <grid size> <number of mines>
```
